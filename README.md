**The Main Menu of SeaBattle consist of 4 buttons which can used by pressing keys from 1 to 4**

*PvP Mode* stands for Player vs Player Mode where you can play with another person on a single computer.


*PvE Mode* is about playing against BOT.

*Report Bug* is for reporting bugs, it simply redirects you to GitHub repo page.

*Exit* exits the game. How obvious!

*Also there are 3 wonderful chiptune tracks, which fits a retro atmosphere of CLI applications.*
## Ship Placement

**Important part of SeaBattle is a Ship Placement part.**

To place ships correctly, follow these simple instructions:
1) Use 1, 2, 3, 4 keyboard buttons to select ship size you would like to place. Notice that you can place
ships randomly by pressing "r".

2) Input 3 characters. The first two are for coordinates. The third one are for ship orientation. "v" stands for vertical, "h" for horizontal. For example, "b2v" is for place ship at B2 vertically.

## Game

Just input coordinates to shoot. If you'll hit, your turn continues. Otherwise it will be another player turn.
You need to destroy all ships to win. (Score 20 points).

## In conclusion
To sum up, I need to mention that this game I wrote without using any help on internet, just for testing my own skills. As it turns out, I wrote incredibly unoptimized piece of code, but I to be frank, I reached an algorithm I invented!
